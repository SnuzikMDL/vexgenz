        <h2>1. General Provisions</h2>
        <p>1.1 These rules are compiled by a representative of the Vexgenz project and apply to all game modes of the Vexgenz project. Ignorance of the rules does not exempt violators from responsibility and may aggravate the punishment.</p>
        <p>1.2 The Vexgenz project is a server located at the following address: <span class="font-medium text-[#0064FF]">vexgenz.minefort.com</span>. All other domains are not affiliated. By joining our project, you automatically accept these rules, as well as the rules of other game modes.</p>
        <p>1.3 The rules may be changed without explicit notification to the main project audience. Significant rule changes will be announced on the project’s Discord server.</p>
        <p>1.4 Decisions and actions of the main administration (scamingdev (SnuzikMDL), wspr1) are not subject to discussion or appeal. The main administration has the right to issue punishments outside the scope of these rules.</p>
        <p>1.5 The server administration does not issue in-game resources or compensation for losses due to server kicks, lags, bugs, or actions of players using prohibited software (cheats).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="joining">
        <h2>2. Joining Rules</h2>
        <p>2.1 A user’s nickname must be appropriate. Inappropriate nicknames include those that violate the established rules, as well as: <span class="penalty">[lifetime account ban]</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2.2 Nicknames similar to those of the main administration.</li>
            <li>2.3 Nicknames with sexual or immoral content (e.g., names of sexual organs, processes, etc.).</li>
            <li>2.4 Nicknames that insult another player’s nickname.</li>
            <li>2.5 Nicknames containing names of prohibited software (e.g., MeteorClient1448).</li>
            <li>2.6 Nicknames containing explicit profanity.</li>

    <div class="section" id="purchases">
        <h2>3. Purchase of Paid Services</h2>
        <p>3.1 Playing on the project does not require payment for the use of Vexgenz resources.</p>
        <p>3.2 Players may voluntarily pay a certain amount to the project for in-game services unilaterally.</p>
        <p>3.3 In case of payment errors or non-delivery of in-game services after payment, contact support with the electronic receipt sent to your email. Without a receipt, recovery services will be denied. The project does not resend receipts for security reasons. Keep your receipt at the time of payment or find it in your email.</p>
        <p>3.4 There are no refunds for purchases, as Vexgenz is not a commercial organization, and all purchases are considered voluntary donations for server development.</p>
        <p>3.5 Purchasing premium groups does not grant immunity from these rules or their violations.</p>
